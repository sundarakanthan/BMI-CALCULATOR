<h1>BMI CALCULATOR</h1>
This is a simple BMI calculator Web app built using HTML, Javascript, NodeJS and ExpressJS. This is a very simple BMI calculator app built to implement my learning.
The key difference is this app runs using a server rather than running on the client side.
<h3>What's the difference between running a app on server side and client side?</h3>
Running an app on the client side usually involves running the backend code such as scripts on the client side itself. That is running those scripts on the user's browser
<br>
But running the app on server side involves running the scrips, performing the calculations on the server side and producing the result on client side. 
To verify this open up the Page source and we can see only the front end code. This is because the backend code is running on the server.

Here I used Express JS to create server to run my application which performs the backend tasks.<br>
I have used the BodyParser library to extract the incoming request's data. <br>
